# sensor-data
This is a simple web application built solely using JavaScript and HTML, which can be used to collect data from motion sensors(such as accelerometers and gyroscopes), especially in mobile devices (or any device with a motion sensor built in it). It requires the users to allow permission to access the motion sensors through the web browsers.
### How to allow permissions through the web browser:
1. On your web browser, navigate to the settings.
2. Find the section for site settings or permissions.
3. Locate the option for motion sensors or device sensors.
4. Enable access to this application to get your sensor data.
5. Refresh the page and click on Start Recording.
